# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a fresh GitLab repository (`acme-zero`) that appears to be in its initial setup phase. The repository currently contains only a default GitLab README.md template with standard project setup instructions.

This project will be used to bootstrap an ACME cluster. The ACME cluster will be a ROSA HCP cluster.
The bootstrap process will install the initial set of applications on the ACME cluster.


## Current State

- This is a new/empty repository with minimal content
- Only contains the default GitLab README.md template
- No application code, build systems, or development tooling has been set up yet
- No existing configuration files for development tools (package.json, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Git repository is initialized on the `main` branch

## Development Approach

Since this is an empty repository, development decisions will need to be made based on:
- User requirements and technology stack preferences
- The type of application being built
- Language and framework choices

When code is added to this repository, this CLAUDE.md file should be updated to include:
- Build, test, and lint commands specific to the chosen technology stack
- Project architecture and structure information
- Development workflow and conventions
